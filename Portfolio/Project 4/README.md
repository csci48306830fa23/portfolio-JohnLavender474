# VR Maze Search - Unity Team Project

Welcome to the README.md for the VR Maze Search Unity team project. In this immersive, headset-based VR simulation, our goal is to create an engaging experience that challenges users to find and retrieve objects while also involving locomotion and manipulation within a VR environment. This document provides an overview of the project's objectives, requirements, team members, and submission details.

## Project Description

**Project Name:** VR Maze Search

**Project Goal:** Design an End-To-End VR Application that involves locomotion and manipulation.

**Project Description:** In this project, we will create an immersive VR simulation that requires users to find and retrieve objects while performing tasks involving object manipulation. The VR scene will be designed from scratch, and at least one object will be created using techniques discussed in class. The project should meet the following requirements:

### Requirements

- **Custom Scene:** The scene architecture should be custom-made, and at least one object should be created by the team.

- **Locomotion:** Users should be able to move within the scene using VR locomotion techniques, other than physical walking.

- **Scene Complexity:** The scene must be sufficiently large and complex to necessitate locomotion other than walking (bigger than the guardian space).

- **Interactivity:** Objects that appear interactable should be pickable.

- **Distance Interactions:** Some interactions should occur at a distance.

- **GUI:** There should be a graphical user interface within the VR world.

- **Lightmapping:** The scene should be lightmapped, with shadows acceptable only on Desktop platforms.

- **3D Spatial Audio:** The scene should have relevant 3D spatial audio.

- **Git Repository:** Use Git to track changes in the Unity project and ensure a proper .gitignore file to exclude unintended folders.

- **Task Completion:** The application must include at least one start-to-end task. Users should be able to initiate, complete, and restart the task.

### Graduate Student Requirements (20% of the overall grade)

- Collect user trajectory data within the maze, including HMD position, up vector, and forward vector.

- Display the user's trajectory through the maze based on recorded data.

- Allow export of trajectory data.

### Grading Rubric

- **A:** All required elements present, well-executed with creativity.

- **B:** All required elements present, but usability issues exist.

- **C:** Some elements missing, but the task is still feasible.

- **D or Lower:** The task is trivial or impossible to complete due to missing features or implementation errors.

## Team Members

- **Person 1:** ![Picture](john_smith.jpg)
    - Person 1 was responsible for scene design, locomotion implementation, and audio integration. They also contributed to object manipulation and GUI development.

- **Person 2:** ![Picture](sarah_johnson.jpg)
    - Person 2 created custom 3D objects and designed the maze layout. They also worked on distance interactions and task implementation.

- **Person 3:** ![Picture](michael_brown.jpg)
    - Person 3 focused on trajectory data collection, storage, and export functionalities. They also contributed to scene testing and optimization.

- **Person 4:** ![Picture](emily_davis.jpg)
    - Person 4 worked on the graphical user interface, ensuring a user-friendly experience. They also contributed to scene lighting and audio.

## Submission

To submit our project, we will follow these steps:

1. Ensure that our Git Repository is up to date, with all work pushed to GitHub.

2. Check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/team-vr-maze-search) for the latest updates.

3. Edit the `readme.md` file in the root of the GitHub repository with the following information:
    - Full names of team members.
    - Brief descriptions of individual contributions (< 500 words).
    - Any problems encountered during development.

4. Create a short video (< 3 minutes) showing a user completing our VR task from the "head camera." If possible, include an inset "live" view from a real-world camera (e.g., Zoom) to enhance the presentation.

Thank you for your interest in our VR Maze Search project. We look forward to showcasing our immersive VR experience!
